Below is the bookData array that contains other arrays. Each inner array consists of the property name (first element), and the value (second element). 
For example, in ['title', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach'], 'title' is the property name, and 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach' is meant to be the value assigned to that property name.
Using computed properties, fill the newBook object with the properties and values from the bookData array. The first one is done already.
